### **1.0 Overview of Financial Statements**

Financial statements are **reports that summarize the activities and financial performance of a business**. They are prepared at the end of each accounting period to provide investors and lenders with a sense of a business's financial health.

The **three main financial statements** are:
1.  **The Balance Sheet**
2.  **The Income Statement**
3.  **The Cash Flow Statement**

#### **1.1 The Inter-relationship of Statements**
This diagram illustrates how the core components are linked:
```
Balance Sheet => Assets =    Liabilities    + Equity
                          (For third party) (For Owners)
                                                ^
                                                |
                         Capital Contribution + Retained Earnings
                                                ^
                                                |

### **2.0 The Core Financial Statements in Detail**

#### **2.1 The Balance Sheet**

* **Definition**: The balance sheet is a financial statement that provides a **snapshot of a business's assets, liabilities, and equity at a single point in time**. It is also known as the statement of financial position.
* **Purpose**: It shows **what a business owns** (assets) and **what it owes** (liabilities and equity). It also reveals how much the business is worth to its owners.
* **Structure**:
    * The header includes the business's name, the statement name, and the specific date of the snapshot (e.g., December 31st).
    * The **left side lists everything the business owns – its assets**.
    * The **right side lists everything the business owes – its liabilities and equity**. Liabilities are owed to third parties (like suppliers, employees, tax office), while equity is owed back to the owners.
* **The Accounting Equation**: A fundamental principle is that a balance sheet always has to balance because of the accounting equation.
    * **Assets = Liabilities + Equity**.
    * This means "the stuff that a business owns is equal to the stuff that a business owes".
    * Equity represents the **residual value of an entity's assets after deducting all its liabilities**, also referred to as **net assets**. It also represents the **net funds invested into a business by its owners**.

#### **2.2 The Income Statement**

* **Definition**: An income statement **summarizes a business's revenues and expenses over a period of time**. Unlike the balance sheet's snapshot, it's more like a "video or a boomerang" covering a range of time (e.g., "The year ended December 31st"). It's also called the **statement of profit and loss**.
* **Purpose**: It tells us **how much profit the business earned over a period of time**.
* **Components & Structure**:
    * **Sales**
    * (-) **COGS** (Cost of Goods Sold)
    * **= Gross Profit**
    * (-) **Operating Expenses**
    * **= Operating Income**
    * (-/+) **Non-operating Income/Expenses**
    * **= Pretax Income**
    * (-) **Taxes**
    * **= Net Income**
* **Important Note**: Profit shown on the income statement **does not necessarily translate to cash flow**. This is why a cash flow statement is also needed.

#### **2.3 The Cash Flow Statement**

* **Definition**: A cash flow statement shows a business's **cash inflows and outflows over a period of time**.
* **Necessity**: Businesses typically need to prepare a cash flow statement if they are using **accrual accounting**.
    * **Cash Method**: Revenue is recognized when cash is received, and expenses are recorded when cash is paid out. Under this method, the income statement and cash flow statement are equivalent. Often used by smaller businesses.
    * **Accrual Method**: Revenue is recognized as it's earned, and expenses are recorded as they are incurred, regardless of when cash changes hands. This means cash inflows/outflows are not always equivalent to revenues/expenses and need to be tracked separately.
* **Structure and Components**:
    * Covers a period of time, similar to the income statement.
    * **Opening and Closing Cash Balances**: These numbers are drawn from the balance sheet.
    * **Main Sections for Cash Flow**: Explains how the net increase or decrease in cash came about.
        * **Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: Covers cash from **regular business activities**, such as selling products and services.
        * **Cash Flow from Investing Activities**: Inflows and outflows from **investments and buying/selling property and equipment**.
        * **Cash Flow from Financing Activities**: All about **funding the business**, including loans from banks or equity from owners.
* **Reconciliation**: The net cash flow from the operating, investing, and financing activities combined should match the net change in cash between the opening and closing balances.

### **3.0 Detailed Breakdown of Balance Sheet Accounts**

#### **3.1 Assets: What a Business Owns or Controls**

* **Definition**: Assets are **probable future economic benefits obtained or controlled by a particular entity as a result of past transactions or events**. They are crucial because they are what a business uses to **operate and generate a profit**.
* **Key Concepts in Definition**:
    * **Probable Future Economic Benefits**: There's a degree of uncertainty, and accountants often make estimates. These benefits are things that bring value to the business, either directly or indirectly.
        * **Useful Economic Life**: An **estimate of how long an asset will remain useful**, leading to its **depreciation** (reduction in value over time). This is different from an asset's actual life.
    * **Obtained or Controlled**: This highlights the accounting principle of **substance over form**, meaning the economic reality of a transaction is prioritized over its legal form. For example, a long-term leased building can be considered an asset if the business controls it for most of its useful life, even if they don't legally own it.
* **Categories of Assets** (typically arranged by liquidity):
    1.  **Current Assets**: Assets that can be **converted into cash within a short period, typically within a year**.
        * **Cash**: The **most liquid asset**.
        * **Accounts Receivable**: Money that **customers owe the business** after purchasing goods or services on credit.
        * **Inventory**: The **physical stock or goods that the business intends to sell** to make a profit.
        * **Prepayments**: Situations where the business has **paid for something in advance** (e.g., rent). It's an asset because it provides future economic benefit.
        * **Short-term Investments**: Investments in stocks or shares that the business plans to **sell within a year**.
    2.  **Non-current Assets (Long-term Assets)**: Assets that are **not easily converted into cash** and are used in operations to generate profits over a longer period.
        * **Long-term Investments**: Investments that the business plans to **hold onto for longer than a year**.
        * **Tangible (or Fixed) Assets**: Assets that have a **physical presence** and can be touched.
            * Common types include **land and buildings**, or **Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE)**, which encompasses items like furniture, machinery, and cars. These assets are subject to **depreciation** over their useful economic life.
        * **Intangible Assets**: Assets that **do not have a physical presence**.
            * Examples include **intellectual property, patents, royalty rights, trademarks, and copyright**.
            * **Valuation Challenge**: Intangible assets can be difficult to value. Generally, businesses **only capitalize (record as an asset on the balance sheet) intangible assets that they purchase from someone else**, holding them at cost value. Internally generated intangible assets are usually not capitalized.
            * **Amortization**: Like tangible assets, intangible assets are **amortized (their value is decreased) over time**.
            * **Goodwill**: A specific intangible asset representing the **amount one company is prepared to pay for another over and above the fair value of its net assets**. It accounts for the premium paid for things like brand recognition and potential future earnings.

#### **3.2 Liabilities: What a Business Owes**

* **Definition**: Liabilities are **probable future sacrifices of economic benefits arising from present obligations of a particular entity to transfer assets or provide services to other entities in the future as a result of past transactions or events**.
    * **Simpler View**: Liabilities are a **source of third-party funding that a business uses to buy assets and fund operations**. They are a normal part of business.
* **Key Concepts in Definition**:
    * **Probable Future Sacrifices**: Hints at uncertainty, requiring judgment to estimate future outcomes, especially with accruals.
    * **Economic Benefit**: Relates to things that have value, specifically assets and services, not only cash.
    * **Present Obligations from Past Transactions/Events**: The transaction committing the entity to transfer assets or provide services must have already occurred.
* **Categories of Liabilities** (typically arranged by due date):
    1.  **Current Liabilities**: Obligations that **need to be settled within one year** from now.
        * **Accounts Payable**: Relate to **bills or invoices received when buying something on credit** from a supplier.
        * **Salaries Payable**: Amounts owed to employees, often recognized at month-end.
        * **Taxes Payable**: Tax owed on profits generated by the business.
        * **Interest Payable**: Interest owed on loans or other borrowings.
        * **Accruals (Accrued Expenses)**: Adjusting entries to recognize expenses that have been **incurred but for which an invoice hasn't been received or payment hasn't been made yet**.
        * **Unearned Revenue**: The **opposite of a prepayment**; arises when someone pays a business for a good or service in advance, creating an **obligation for the business to provide that good or service in the future**.
        * **Short-term Loans**: Loans that must be settled within one year. This can also include the current portion of long-term loans.
    2.  **Non-current Liabilities**: Obligations that are **not expected to be settled within a year**.
        * **Long-term Loans**: Money borrowed from banks or financial institutions that will be repaid over a period longer than one year.
        * **Bonds**: Similar to loans, but money is raised directly from the public as formal IOU notes.
        * **Mortgages**: Loans secured by properties.
        * **Employee Pensions**: Obligations related to employee retirement benefits.
        * **Deferred Income Tax**: A byproduct of timing differences between accounting and taxable profits.
    3.  **Contingent Liabilities**: A **potential obligation that may arise depending on the outcome of an uncertain future event**.
        * **Accounting Treatment**: Depends on management's judgment of the outcome's probability:
            * If **probable and can be reasonably estimated**, record as a loss on the income statement and a liability on the balance sheet.
            * If only **possible or remote**, it might only be noted in the footnotes, or not disclosed at all.

#### **3.3 Equity: What the Owners Claim**

* **Definition 1**: Equity is the **residual value of an entity's assets after deducting all its liabilities**. It represents the **net assets of a business**.
* **Definition 2**: Equity represents the **net funds invested into a business by its owners**. It is one of the two broad financing options (the other being liabilities).
* **Components of Equity**:
    1.  **Capital Contributions**: The **money that the owners invest into the business out of their own pockets**.
        * **Terminology by Business Structure**:
            * **Owner's Equity**: For a **sole proprietor**.
            * **Partner Contributions**: For a **partnership**.
            * **Shareholders' Equity**: For a **corporation**.
    2.  **Retained Earnings**: Defined as **accumulated profit held for future use**.
        * **Composition**: Made up of **accumulated profits** (revenues less expenses) **less withdrawals**.
        * **Terminology**: This term **stays the same** regardless of business structure.
    3.  **Withdrawals**: The **money that is taken out of the business and distributed to its owners**.
        * **Impact on Accounting Equation**: Drawings decrease both assets (cash) and owner's equity.
        * **Terminology by Business Structure**:
            * **Drawings**: For **sole proprietors**.
            * **Partner Drawings**: For **partnerships**.
            * **Dividends**: For **corporations**.

### **4.0 Dynamics and Definitions of Key Items**

#### **4.1 Important State / Dynamics of Line Items**
* **Cash**: Changes every day with every sale and every expense. It's the most dynamic number.
* **Net PPE**: Changes when the company buys new buildings (Capex) or when old ones lose value (Depreciation).
* **Total Debt**: Changes if the company borrows more money or pays back old loans.
* **Retained Earnings**: Changes every year when the company makes a new profit and decides how much of it to keep.
* **Common Stock**: Total nominal or "par" value of all the shares of ownership that a company has sold to investors.
    * Changes if the company issues new shares (increase) or repurchases stock (decrease), which is a big event, not a routine operational activity.
* **Goodwill**: Usually doesn't change unless the company buys another company.
* **Accounts Receivable**: Money that a company's customers owe for goods or services that have already been delivered but not yet paid for. It is an asset.
* **Accounts Payable**: Money that a company owes to its suppliers for goods or services that it has already received but has not yet paid for. It is a liability.
* **Cash Flow from Investing**: Represents the cash spent on or received from a company's long-term assets.
* **Capital Expenditures**: The cash spent on buying or upgrading physical assets.
    * This is the money the company is investing in its future growth. It is almost always a cash outflow.
    * "Capital" refers to long-term assets a company uses to generate value.

#### **4.2 Derived Variables for Analysis**
* **Profitability (Operating Margin)**: Shows what percentage of revenue is left after paying for core, day-to-day business expenses.
    * `Operating Margin = Operating Income / Revenue`
* **Effective Interest Rate**: `Interest Expense / Total Debt`
* **Tax Rate**: `Tax Provision / Pretax Income`

### **5.0 Financial Forecasting Framework**

#### **5.1 Income Statement Forecast for Year `t+1`**

| Line Item | How to Forecast | Based On |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sales** | `Sales(t) * (1 + Growth Rate)` | `Sales_Growth_Rate` assumption |
| **Operating Income**| `Sales(t+1) * Operating Margin` | Historical `Operating_Margin` ratio |
| **Interest Expense**| `Total Debt(t) * Interest Rate` | Historical `Interest_Rate` ratio |
| **Pretax Income** | `Operating Income(t+1) - Interest Expense(t+1)` | *Result of above* |
| **Tax Provision** | `Pretax Income(t+1) * Tax Rate` | Historical `Tax_Rate` ratio |
| **Net Income** | `Pretax Income(t+1) - Tax Provision(t+1)` | *Final result* |

* **Why skip COGS/Gross Profit/Operating Income breakdown in simple models?**
    * **Reason 1: Simplicity**: It combines two steps (COGS and Operating Expenses) into one, making the model easier to build and debug.
    * **Reason 2: Data Stability**: For many companies, the overall Operating Margin is more stable and predictable than the individual Gross Margin and Operating Expense percentages.

#### **5.2 Bridge to Cash Flow Statement**

* **Concept**: The `Net Income` from the Income Statement is an accounting profit, not a cash profit. We must adjust it.
* **Forecasting Cash Flow from Operations (CFO)**:
    * $CFO = \text{Net Income} + \text{Depreciation} - (\text{Increase in Accounts Receivable}) + (\text{Increase in Accounts Payable})$
    * **Depreciation**: `Depreciation(next year) = Net_PPE(this year) * (Depreciation(this year) / Net_PPE(this year))`
    * **Increase in AR**: `AR(next year) - AR(this year)` where `AR(next year) = Sales(next year) * (AR(this year) / Sales(this year))`
    * **Increase in AP**: `AP(next year) - AP(this year)` where `AP(next year) = COGS(next year) * (AP(this year) / COGS(this year))`
* **Forecasting Cash Flow from Investing (CFI)**:
    * **Capex**: `Capex(next year) = Sales(next year) * (Capex(this year) / Sales(this year))`
    * CFI is primarily driven by Capex, which is an outflow.
* **Forecasting Cash Flow from Financing (CFF)**:
    * **Dividends Paid**: `Dividends_Paid(next year) = Net_Income(next year) * (Dividends_Paid(this year) / Net_Income(this year))`
* **Net Cash Flow Formulas**:
    * **Precise Formula**: `Net Cash Flow = (Net Income + Depreciation - ΔAR + ΔAP) - Capex - Dividends Paid`
    * **Simplified Formula**: `Net Cash Flow = (Net Income + Depreciation) - Capex - Dividends Paid`
